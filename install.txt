Installation notes:
The card will work with the original GUS PnP DOS/Windows 3.11 drivers (PNPV22B.ZIP)
After assembling the card, it's required to initially program the PNPROM so the card reserves its' resources when called by IWINIT.
Failing to do so will cause the IWINIT program to hang. After using the PNPMAP program the card can be configured with the usual tools
(i.e. setup.exe from the GUS PnP drivers).
In case you're using a copy of the IW78C21M1 ROM contents or an original chip it's also a good idea to do a checksum test of them.

PNPROM (programming PnP ROM):
-----------------------
1) boot system without IWINIT, if already installed
2) pnpmap /f gravnocd.rom (included in the PNPMAP directory)
3) Cold(!) reboot with GUS PnP drivers
4) Card should be detected and operational
5) IWINIT -v9 to check resources, total RAM found, name of Wavetable ROM (if present)

IW78C21M1 (checksuming Wavetable ROM):
-----------------------
1) IWDUMP ROM FILE=IWROM.BIN START=0 SIZE=1M
2) md5sum.exe IWROM.BIN
3) Output checksum should be the same as checksum.jpg when using an 'original' IW78C21M1 ROM

RAM:
-----------------------
You can check the Bank configuration either using the Windows 3.11 driver or the GUS/InterWave Info screen in XTC-Play (F3)
RAM can be checked using setup.exe from the GUS PnP drivers 2.23
