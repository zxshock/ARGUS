		    UltraSound Plug & Play Preparation

This is the "UltraSound PnP 2.0 Preparation Disk" that is used with both the
Windows 95 and DOS / Windows 3.x software setups / installs.

The enclosed ROM file, GRAVIS.ROM, is a newly updated EEPROM file that
reduces your IRQ usage for the UltraSound Plug & Play card as well as
providing better support for Plug & Play BIOSes and Windows 95.

Refer to the README. files on the other disks
("UltraSound PnP 2.0 Win 95 Disk" or "UltraSound PnP 2.0 DOS/Win 3.x Disk")
for instructions upgrading your UltraSound's EEPROM during the
installation process.

However you can also upgrade your EEPROM at any time via the following:

1.      If you have any other Plug & Play devices in your system, we
        recommend you shut down your computer and remove them.

2.      If you are running Windows 3.x exit Windows.

3.      If you are running Windows 95 restart the computer in MS-DOS mode.
        (Start->ShutDown->Restart the computer in MS-DOS mode?).

4.      At the Command Prompt, insert the 'Public BETA Preparation Disk'.

5. 	Type A:  <Enter>  to go to your A drive.

6. 	Type   PNPMAP /f GRAVIS.ROM   <Enter>

7.      When prompted, hit Y <enter> to confirm re-writing your EEPROM on the
        UltraSound Plug & Play Card.

8.      When the program exists and you are back at the DOS prompt, remove
        the floppy disk and power down your machine. When you power you
        machine back up, the new ROM file will be in effect.

There are 2 other ROM files enclosed on this disk.

GRAVNOCD.ROM is similar to GRAVIS.ROM except that it has the IDE CD-ROM
Interface disabled. If you are not using the CD-ROM Interface you should
use this ROM file as it will reduce the number of resources your UltraSound
uses.

OLDGRAV.ROM is an older UltraSound Plug & Play ROM file which you can go back
to should either of the new ROM files create any new problems for you.

To use these ROM files, follow the instructions above except substitite the
name of the ROM file you wish to use in place of GRAVIS.ROM.
